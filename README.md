This is the public github repository for the "Securing your critical workloads with IBM Hyper Protect Services, SG248469" IBM Redbooks.

## Code Patterns

Some worked examples in this book use the code pattern *Disaster Donations Website*, available at the following Github repository: https://github.com/IBM/disaster-donations-website. This code pattern is an example application, consisting of a frontend container written using Node.js and backend container written using Python, that you can build, deploy, and run using either IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Servers or IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.
